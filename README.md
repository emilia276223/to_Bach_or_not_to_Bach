# To Bach or not to Bach
Classification of music pieces based on the MIDI files

## Data

We found a few datasets containing MIDI files divided by composers. We decided to use the MIDI files for the chosen composers:
* Bach
* Brahms
* HÃ¤ndel
* Schubert
* Vivaldi
* Beethoven
* Chopin
* Haydn
* Mozart
* Schumann

We extracted features from the MIDI files that seem useful for composer recognition. We used these features to train and test the model. 

## Goal

The goal is to teach chosen models to classify the music (by features) to its composer.

## Result

You can find our final code here, along with the final presentation (results, plots, diagrams and some nice memes).
