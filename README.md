Classification of music pieces based on the MIDI files

## Data

We found datasets containing MIDI files segregated by a composer. We decided to use the MIDI files from both datasets but for the chosen composers:
* Bach
* Brahms
* Haendel
* Mendelssohn
* Schubert
* Vivaldi
* Beethoven
* Chopin
* Haydn
* Mozart
* Schumann

From the MIDI files we extract featues that seem useful for composer recognition. Theese features will be used to train and test the model.

## Goal

The goal is to teach chosen models to classify the music (by features) to it's composer.
