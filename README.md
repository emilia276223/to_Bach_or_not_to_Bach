Classification of music pieces based on the MIDI files

## Data

We found 2 datasets containing MIDI files divided by composers. We decided to use the MIDI files from both datasets, but for the chosen composers:
* Bach
* Brahms
* Haendel
* Mendelssohn
* Schubert
* Vivaldi
* Beethoven
* Chopin
* Haydn
* Mozart
* Schumann

We extract features from the MIDI files that seem useful for composer recognition. We will use these features to train and test the model.

## Goal

The goal is to teach chosen models to classify the music (by features) to its composer.
